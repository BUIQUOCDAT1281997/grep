As a traditional family in Viet nam, I have a big one. My family has 5 members, including Mom, Dad, 
Grandma, sister, and me. My mom name is Giang. She has long hair and black eyes. She is a 
teacher. My Dad name is Trung. He is tall and very strong. His job is doctor. For me, my mom is 
the most beautiful woman, and my dad is the most wonderful man. And my grandma name is 
Tam. She is 95 years old, and next 5 years, we will organize the 100th longevity wishing ceremony, 
and I look forward to taking part in this ceremony. Besides, another woman who I love so much is 
my sister. Her name is Linh. She is 26 years old, and she is a beautiful woman like Mom. Now, she 
is living in Ha Noi capital Viet nam, because of her jobs. I really love my family, and I hope that we 
are always together anyway.
